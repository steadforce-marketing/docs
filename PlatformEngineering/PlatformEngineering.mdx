# Platform Engineering

Platform Engineering is a discipline focused on building and maintaining internal platforms that empower development teams to deliver software faster, more securely, and with greater autonomy.

## Why Platform Engineering?

Modern software delivery environments are complex. Teams need infrastructure, automation, observability, and security – all while keeping cognitive load low. Platform Engineering provides:

- **Reusable, self-service tools**  
- **Infrastructure as Code & automation**
- **Standardized environments**
- **Improved developer experience**

## Key Components

### 1. Internal Developer Platform (IDP)

An IDP is a curated set of tools and workflows designed to reduce friction and enable developers to ship code efficiently.

### 2. Kubernetes & Container Orchestration

Many platforms are built on Kubernetes to provide scalable, portable infrastructure.

### 3. CI/CD Integration

Automated pipelines for build, test, deploy – tailored to team needs but based on platform standards.

### 4. Observability & Security

Built-in monitoring, logging, tracing, and security policies that apply across all workloads.

## Benefits

- 🚀 **Speed**: Developers ship features faster with less setup.
- 🔐 **Security**: Standardized security practices reduce risk.
- 🧠 **Simplicity**: Teams don’t need to reinvent infrastructure.
- 📈 **Scalability**: Platforms evolve with the company.

## Example Use Case

<Tabs groupId="cloud">
  <TabItem value="manufacturing" label="Manufacturing">
    A manufacturing company uses a platform to deploy edge apps in factories, manage their data pipelines, and monitor all clusters centrally – all while developers use GitOps workflows.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="finance" label="Finance">
    A financial services provider automates infrastructure provisioning and ensures all services follow compliance standards by default – thanks to a central platform team.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
